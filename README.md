# Deltarune Save Manager

This is a program that can organize and backup saves for you using python!

The only versions that are now being updated are `Deltarune Save Manager.exe` and `main-gui.pyw`

## Installation

Download all files and run `Deltarune Save Manager.exe` to start the program.

It is still possible to run the `.pyw` version as well if you have python and the relevant modules installed on your computer.
